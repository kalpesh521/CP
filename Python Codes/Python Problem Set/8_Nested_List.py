There are  students in this class whose names and grades are assembled to build the following list:

python students = [['Harry', 37.21], ['Berry', 37.21], ['Tina', 37.2], ['Akriti', 41], ['Harsh', 39]]

The lowest grade of  belongs to Tina. The second lowest grade of  belongs to both Harry and Berry, so we order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

        if score in dic:
            dic[score].append(name)
        else:

        if score not in s:
            s.append(score)

s.remove(m)

dic[m1].sort()
